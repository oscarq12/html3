				<h3> Adding links and Much More </h3>

			<p>
				Carrying on with what I have learned in class so far, is pretty fascinating but I can definitely see why some web designers are always stressed with choosing this career. Furthermore, I did not know this was really what the behind the scenes of a website took to create. It is still a slow process for me to comprehend but I am applying myself to this course to get something out of it, even if I do not pursue this as a career.
